# Disaster-and-Food-Insecurity 
###  Research Question: 
What are the impacts of disaster(natural) on the food security as defined by the Food and Agriculture institution(FAO)
The independent variable is the magnitude of the disasters that occurred at a given year and given country. The dependent variable would be the prevalence of food insecurity measured by indicators : prevalence of undernourishment and prevalence of severe food insecurity, and prevalence of moderate food insecurity. These values are measured by FAO.

EMDAT Centre for Centre for Research on Epidemiology of Disasters is a non profit that later became one of the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre . EMDAT keeps the database for all occurances for natural disasters and quantifies its effects. As of 2022, it has recorded over 22,000 mass disasters in the world from 1900 to the present day.

## ABOUT THE RESEARCH
  Hunger is a global issue and millions of people are suffering from it. Food insecurity is defined by FAO as the lack of availability at all times of adequate world food supplies of basic foodstuffs to sustain a steady expansion of food consumption and to offset fluctuations in production and prices. Similarly, climate change is a pressing issue and its frequency is increasing. These disasters can have devastating impacts on food insecurity. This research paper, aims to address this issue and examine the impact of disasters on food insecurity (specifically % of malnourishment). This can help us anticipate the impact of disasters on food insecurity which can help us prepare and direct resources appropriately in disasters impacted areas. Our research can help anticipate impacts of disasters on food insecurity and minimize the impacts on vulnerable populations.
